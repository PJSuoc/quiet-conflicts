# Quiet Conflicts

Paul Soltys

There has been a huge quantity of media focus on the most active conflicts currently in the world, particularly in Ukraine and in the Middle East. However, violence continues to persist in other lower-level conflicts and regions with significant unrest. The goal of this project is to look more closely at the status of these other areas with significant violence, and their possible consequences on people.
