# Quiet Conflicts

Paul Soltys

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

My goal is to highlight the conflicts and violence impacting civilians outside of the 2 major conflict zones that the world currently sees centered on Ukraine and Palestine. These dominate news covered in a way that, based on some of this data, seems extremely disproportionate when compared to the impact these other areas seem to be facing.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

The main challenge with some of the data is just that the civilians impacted statistic is actually quite difficult to represent in a non-misleading way, because it doesn't represent unique civilians impacted overall, just the number of people possibly impacted by each event. Properly utilizing it as a potentially useful context piece for refugee counts is something that I find quite helpful for the narrative being put together, and it is quite easy to misrepresent that data.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

Images Described in order of viewing, also tagged with numbers in saved folder.

1. Ukraine and Palestine dominate media coverage when it comes to violence, but the rest of the world still sees significant violent conflict according to the ACLED database on violent events. As seen here, violence in the rest of the world more than matches these high-media-attention conflict overall, although the categories are different.

2. ACLED breaks down the events they record into categories and sub-categories, as seen here. Some non-violent categories are excluded. This chart is merely to let the reader know the differences for when it is used later as well as to provide some insight on frequency.

Everything past this point focuses on the smaller conflicts only.

3. 4. Where is violence occurring? These maps display the raw counts of violence events, as well as a violent events per 100,000 people to highlight where conflict is the most intense. This helps highlight Africa and Myanmar in particular, and provides a way to highlight how some countries are experiencing a significant level of violence that spread out across many individuals in places where gangs, riots, and the like are the most common causes of violence.

5. The heatmap using subcategories is to highlight how different violence can be from country-to-country. A viewer more up-to-date with these areas could read into the types of violence endemic to specific conflict types or security issues, but the chart can function on it's own to merely highlight that these countries are experiencing types of violence that are fundamentally different in many ways.

6. This set of plots allows the viewer to look at the time trend for individual conflicts to see if they are escalating or deescalating. While many conflicts remain relatively flat, particularly at lower levels of violence, some areas (Sudan and Syria in particular) are seeing some significant conflict increases.

7. The plot displays the number of events against the median number of civilians impacted, which shows where violent events are occurring in more populated areas, and thus have the ability to impact more people. Conflicts in Syria and Myanmar, while intense, appear to be occurring primarily in rural areas, whereas places like Brazil and Mexico are seeing the most violence in heavily populated areas.

8. This plot investigates whether net migration to/from these countries is potentially driven by violence levels. It uses possible civilians impacted by violence as the number comparing to net migration, as that more likely matches if people want to leave the country than the raw number of violent events. There is a lack of clear trend in this chart, indicating that violence in these places doesn't seen to be a primary motivator for migration even if it is a signficant one sometimes.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)

At this point I am angling towards an infographic- I don't think these images will necessarily require significant textual explanation, but a few sentences here and there will be quite effective in guiding the reader, and the overall point is a pretty simple one even if the images go into significantly more detail.
